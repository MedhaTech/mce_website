                  <p class="text-justify">The Literary Club organizes “THE MALNAD FEST”, the college’s annual fest, featuring over 35 sub-events. It is celebrated as the biggest fest in the college. It is organized during the even semester and it happens for 2 to 3 days. The fest starts with  a spectacular event called “ETHNIC DAY”. This is the most loved part of the fest as each and everyone dresses up and uplifts the culture and heritage of the nation. Prior to the days of the fest involves lots of qualifying rounds for the D-Day.  </p>
                  
                <p><b>The events are divided into four categories: </b></p>

                <p><b>Buddhimaan </b> – A contest for intellectual minds to showcase their ultimate ingenuity. This category consists of events like Toastmaster, Literati, Quiz etc. It is a testament to the mind to solve mind-boggling questions ranging from current affairs to solving a mystery.  </p>
                <p><b>Darpan </b> - A stage event uniting the college through music and dance performances. It involves Group Singing, UV foot-lose, Vogue and many more. It gives all the participants a chance to dress up and showcase their talents in vivid imagery for the entire college to witness. </p>
